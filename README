This is an extension of the Zora's House website which is a nonprofit aimed at bringing together and empowering 
women of color. Zora's House was having issues with their current email system. They wanted additional functionality 
that allowed their users to be able to make separate chat discussions for people with similar interests and to wanted
to move away from their current system which sent everyone messages. Finally, Zora's House wanted an interactive web 
application with casual language to appear more warm and welcoming to everyone. To implement their solution to the
best of our abilities, we used an H2 Database for the backend along with React for our front end.
